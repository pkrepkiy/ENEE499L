Contour plots

3D plot

sigma of X and sigma of Y

Make sure images are 16 bit

Second moment

Can do project both in ImageJ and Matlab

Making a montage of images




Effective beam radius = sqrt(xxVar) + sqrt(yyVar) (only for round beam)
The program should print xxVar and yyVar separately for non-round beams

X and Y centroid / center of mass

ImageJ: set measurements:
Center of Mass
Integrated density
Skewness

Make sure to crop the beam automatically before the moment calculations
- Possibly crop around 3dB loss?

Subtraction of background

Moment calculator 
- second moment of beam distribution
- get x^2 Var and y^2 Var
- This is used for effective beam dimension 

Create a calibration look-up table- given calibration as a function of distance



I understand the issue. All of the coordinate points INSIDE the beam object are NOT being counted in the sum. Only
the border is being counted.

Factors that can be adjusted:
Number of edge markers (even number)
Threshold of sensitivity (noise floor)
Distance of beyond-checking (i.e. how many points to check beyond the first below the threshold)


At first I found the maximum points

I tried to find the edge points in N, E, S, W and NE, SE, NW, SW

This was not enough so I transitioned to a radial approach to find N evenly spaced points around the edge of the object

Calculating centroid was difficult at first because the points were denser in certain areas

I solved this by identifying internal points

The next issue was to reject high-intensity noise
Another challenge was to find the intensity centroid from the geometric centroid of the beam

Add mask to original array

It took a while to develop a function to calculate the moment centroid of the beam, but I was successful.

I learned about image masking
